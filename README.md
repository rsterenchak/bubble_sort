This program sorts and array of integers using the bubble sort method. Each integer in the array is compared with the integer to its right and swapped based on if it is larger or not. Integers pushed to the end of the unsorted array are then removed (pop()) and added (push()) to the sorted array until there are no longer integers in the unsorted array. To get the final result I utilize the .reverse method built into ruby to attain the final sorted array.
